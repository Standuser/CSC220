prog06
-1. Go to box.miami.edu and make sure you see the version of prog05
   you meant to turn in this morning.  If not, send email to
   vjm@cs.miami.edu right away.

0. Create package prog06 and copy MaintainQueue.java into it.

1. Run MaintainQueue and make sure you know how it works.  It won't
   print the list of names in the queue until you implement toString
   in the next step.  Add a few people, peek, remove, etc.  What
   happens when you remove from an empty queue?  poll?  peek?  element?

2. Implement toString in MaintainQueue.  Visit the elements of
   customers using the new kind of for loop and append them to a
   single String separated by spaces.  Test.

3. In ArrayQueue.java, read and understand offer and peek.
   "Understand" means that you are ready to write either of them on
   the quiz tomorrow!  Implement poll.  Test using MaintainQueue.
   Read and understand the definition of the Iter class.

4. In LinkedQueue.java, read and understand offer and peek.  Implement
   poll.  Implement hasNext() and next() in the Iter class. Unlike
   ArrayQueue.Iter, it needs only one variable to keep track of the
   next node to be visited.  Test using MaintainQueue.

5. Create a class WordStep with a variable

  static UserInterface ui = new GUI();

   and a main method.  In the main method, create a new WordStep and
   store it in a variable named game.  Using ui, ask the user for a
   starting word and a target word.  Ask if the human or the computer
   should play using

    String[] commands = { "Human plays.", "Computer plays." };

   Call game.play or game.solve with the starting word and the target
   word.  Create empty methods so this compiles and runs.

  void play (String start, String target) { }
  void solve (String start, String target) { }

   Inside play, do the following forever (until the return occurs).
   Tell the user the current word (the start) and the target word.
   Ask for the next word.  Set the start word variable to that next
   word.  If it equals the target, tell the user ``You win!'' and
   return.  Otherwise keep looping.  Test.  (Also deal with cancel.)

HOMEWORK

6. In WordStep, create a static boolean method offBy1 which takes two
   String variables as input and returns true if they have the same
   length and differ in exactly one character.

   Modify play so that it uses offBy1.  If the word that the user
   suggests is not one letter away from the current start word, warn
   the user and DO NOT change the current (start) word variable.
   Test.  You still will be able to use nonsense words like "snon".

7. In main, just after creating the new WordStep, ask the user for the
   name of a word file and call game.loadWords(filename).  Add a
   List<String> words to WordStep initialized to an ArrayList<String>,
   and write loadWords that adds all the words in the file to the
   list.

   Write a find method that finds a word in words.  It should return
   the index of the word or -1 if it is not there.  Modify main to
   check that the start and target words are in the list.  Test using
   the file called words (not words.txt by the way) in the prog06
   directory.

8. Modify reallocate() in ArrayQueue to use System.arraycopy.
   Sometimes it has to call it twice.  Test.  Make sure you add enough
   entries when you run MaintainQueue to trigger reallocate().  To
   test set labReallocate to false.  Make sure you do tests with
   first < last    and with   first > last.

9. Modify ArrayQueue.Iter to using a single index variable and no
   count variable.  If the queue is empty, then the constructor shoIuld
   set index=-1.  If index==last, then next() should set index=-1.
   Test by setting labIterator to false.

10. Now to implement WordStep.solve.

   Create an array of int called parents whose length is the same as
   the word list.  Initialize all the entries in parents to -1.

   Create a Queue of Integer.  Put the index of the start word into
   the queue.

   While the queue is not empty, remove an index.  Call the word at
   the index the current word. 

    Go through the list of words and look for words which aren't the start word, don't have parents set yet, and are one letter different from current word.

    For each one you find, put its index into the queue and set parents at that index to
   	the index of the current word.

   Also check if the word is the target.  If it is report success.  To get the solution in reverse order, follow the indices in parents the start word.  

   Display the solution in forward order.  

	Return.




prog07
0. Create package prog07 and add Heap.java.


1. In Heap, go over all the methods up to and including offer.  Make
   sure you understand them.  Implement poll().  It uses ITERATION.

For the final loop, what's the condition on the while?

	The item at index is greater than one of its children.

How do you say this in Java:

	(The item at) index is greater than its left child or
        index is greater than its right child

More specifically

	index has a left child and is greater than that child
	or
	index has a right child and is greater than that child

Once you have this condition, then you need to do the inside of the loop:

	swap index with the smaller child

More specifically

	if right child is less than left child
	then swap index with right
	else swap index with left

Can you get the logic right?  Remember, the parent might not HAVE a
right child.  Who wins then?  Make sure the if condition handles this case.


DUE Wednesday March 6 at 11am

8. Copy your WordStep.java from prog06 to prog07 and change the
   package of the copy to prog07 at the top.


9. Add code to solve so it displays a message about how many times it
   polls the queue.  (Poll is expensive because you have the check the
   entire dictionary for neighbors.)  You should get 481 for "snow" to
   "rain".


10. Add a method

	static int numSteps (int[] parents, int index)

   that takes the parents array and an index as input and returns the
   number of steps back to the start word index (which will have -1).

   For example, if parents is

	[0[ [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
	-1  -1   1   2   1   4   5   4

   then numSteps(parents, 6) returns 3 because

	parents[6] == 5
	parents[5] == 4
	parents[4] == 1
	parents[1] == -1

   so it takes 3 steps, 5, 4, 1, to get to a -1.

   Add a message to solve that tells you how far the target is from
   the start (when you have found the path).


11. Add a static method numDifferent that tells you the number of
    letters that are different in two words.  For example,

	numDifferent("snow", "slot") == 2

    Test it.


12. Add a class IndexComparator (INSIDE the WordStep class!) that
    implements Comparator<Integer>.

    a. Its constructor IndexComparator(parents, target) should take
       the parents array and the target word as arguments and store
       them inside IndexComparator.

    b. The method sumNums(index) returns the number of steps from
       the index to the start index PLUS the number of differences
       between the word at that index and the target word.

    c. The method compare(index1, index2) (required by the Comparator
       interface) should return < 0 if sumNums(index1) is smaller than
       sumNums(index2), = 0 if they have the same value, and > 0
       otherwise. done


13. In solve, switch to using a PriorityQueue<Node> using
    IndexComparator for the Queue.  How many words does it dequeue
    now?  (Should be 117.)


14. Now switch to using your Heap using your Comparator.  It should
    run the same.  Switch back to PriorityQueue for the next part.


13. Unfortunately, you will also notice that the solution for "snow"
    to "rain" is LONGER than before.  Here is how to fix this.

    a. Implement the remove method in Heap.

    b. When WordStep solve dequeues the current word index and looks
       at all elements of the dictionary for neighbors, instead of
       just words with parents[index] == -1, it it should also
       consider words that have

	numSteps(parents, currentIndex) + 1 < numSteps(parents, index)

       If parents[index] != -1, it should remove it from the queue
       before adding it to the queue.  (Yes, REMOVE IT and then add it
       as usual.)

    solve() should now find the same length solution for snow to rain
    but dequeue far fewer words than the prog06 solve().  (Should be 74.)

    Switch back to Heap and make sure it still works right.



IN LAB on Wednesday March 6:


BST.java will be another implementation of a Java Map.  The Node class
has data, left, and right.  In a binary search tree, left is less and
right is greater.

The toString method prints tree sideways.  You have to turn your head
to the left to get the traditional view.  So for instance, when it
prints

        n 4
    l 2
        c 5
b 0
    a 3

it is really the tree

    b
    0
a       l
3       2
      c   n
      5   4


14. Download BST.java.  Implement the private find method using the
   notes.  Methods in BST should use RECURSION not iteration.


15. Implement the private add method using the notes.  Remember that
   you need to say Node<K,V> instead of Node so it works generically.
   Make sure you understand what every line does.  The TA can do some
   examples on the board.  Now, implement the public put method using
   add.  What do you do with the value add returns?

   Test the program.  The output should be as in tree-output.txt, only
   the removes won't happen.


16. Delete the first two lines from the public remove method.
   Implement the private remove method based on the notes.  It will
   call removeRoot.


17. Implement removeRoot.  It will call getMinimum and removeMinimum.
   The node returned by getMinimum becomes the root.


18. Implement getMinimum and removeMinimum.
